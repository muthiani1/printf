##Description

ALX printf project

This is a team project in the Software Engineering course by ALX that aims to replicate the C printf function.

Lessons from this project
* How to collaborate in git
* Applying learned concepts in big projects
* Complexities of printf
* Working with multiple files

#Prototype

'int _printf(const char *format, ...);'

#Usage
* Prints a string to the standard output based on provided format
* Returns the number of characters in the output string on success, -1 otherwise
* Used in the same ways as printf

#Examples
* '_printf("Hello, world\n")' prints "Hello, world", followed by a new line
* '_printf("I am %d years old\n", age) prints subsituting the format specifier with the age value

#Tasks
